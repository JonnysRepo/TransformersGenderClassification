# TransformersGenderClassification

This project explores fine-tuning transformers using the Hugging Face library for gender classification based on collected from FaceBook.

For a comprehensive guide on the methods and implementation, refer to the article on Medium: [Fine Tuning Transformers with Hugging Face for Text Classification]([https://medium.com/@AI_MLwithJonny/fine-tuning-transformers-with-hugging-face-for-text-classification-a10d1b05f961](https://medium.com/@AI_MLwithJonny/fine-tuning-transformers-with-hugging-face-for-text-classification-a10d1b05f961)).

## Overview

- **Objective**: Classify gender from FaceBook page names using an advanced transformer model.
- **Tools**: Utilizes Hugging Face's powerful transformer library for efficient fine-tuning.
